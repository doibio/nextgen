Almost 50% of patients with uveal melanoma (UM) develop metastatic disease (i.e., mqetastatic uveal melanoma (mUM)), despite successful treatment of the primary ocular tumour.

Metastatic disease usually involves the liver and is commonly fatal within a year of the onset of symptoms

Systemic therapy for metastases rarely prolongs life however, recent clinical trials have shown encouraging results with tebentafusp (formerly IMCgp100), a first-in-class, bispecific, fusion protein that redirects CD3+ T cells to gp100-expressing melanoma cells, inducing cytolysis

In this review, we describe UM, cancer immunotherapy and the research that has translated tebentafusp from the laboratory to clinical trials.

UM threatens patients with visual handicap, a painful eye, facial disfigurement and untimely death from a metastatic disease .

The incidence is approximately six cases per million people per year .

Approximately 90% of UMs involve the choroid; the remainder being confined to the iris or the ciliary body .

Presentation almost always occurs in adulthood, peaking at around the age of 60 years .

Males are more commonly affected than females .

The large majority of patients are white, and a light-coloured iris is a risk factor .

Other predisposing factors include ocular melanocytoma, congenital ocular melanocytosis and the BAP1 tumour predisposition syndrome .

Approximately 80% of UMs arise from mutations in the G alpha pathway (via mutually exclusive mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, PLCB4 or CYSLTR2) .

This is in contrast to cutaneous melanoma (CM), the most common form of melanoma , which commonly harbours BRAF and NRAS mutations .
