Tebentafusp is a novel type of treatment for uveal melanoma, a rare and aggressive form of eye cancer. It's a type of therapy known as a bispecific fusion protein that combines two proteins: a T cell receptor and an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. This allows it to direct the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. It was developed by Immunocore and as of 2021, it is under review by the FDA for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal melanoma.
