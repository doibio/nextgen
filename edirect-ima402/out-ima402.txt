This study was designed to determine the feasibility of anastomosing the 
internal mammary artery (IMA) and coronary artery with a carbon dioxide laser in 
a canine model. Twenty-two mongrel dogs were randomly assigned to two groups: 
group I (n = 11) underwent laser-assisted vascular anastomosis (LAVA) of the 
left IMA to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, whereas in group 
II (n = 11) the anastomosis was done with the conventional technique (handsewn). 
Laser methodology was used to micro-weld vessels utilizing a power of 200 mW 
with a spot size of 500 mu, producing an effective power density of 102 W/cm2 
and energy fluence of 9,172 joules/cm2 in a continuous mode at a distance of 2 
cm. The short-term patency rate, measured at 2 hours after completion of the 
anastomosis, was 100% in both groups. The time required to perform the LAVA in 
group I was significantly shorter than group II (6.27 +/- 0.47 vs 11.6 +/- 0.67 
min, p less than 0.05). The mean anastomotic bursting pressure in group I was 
significantly lower compared to group II (348 +/- 8 vs 402 +/- 9 mmHg, p less 
than 0.05). Histologic evaluation of all vessels showed moderate thermal injury 
of the adventitia and media in the laser group. Scanning electron microscopy 
exhibited a smooth anastomotic area in group I, whereas endothelial and 
perianastomotic changes with multiple needle craters occurred in group II 
(conventional anastomosis).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Use of the mammary artery in coronary revascularization].

[Article in German]

Oster H, Dapper F, Tsilimingas N, Leitz KH.

From August 1983 through December 1985 1088 patients underwent coronary surgery. 
406 (37%) received a single or bilateral internal mammary artery (IMA) graft 
with single or sequential anastomoses. The youngest patient was 6 years old, the 
oldest 75, with a mean age of 55.7 years. A total of 672 IMA anastomoses was 
constructed. In addition 348 patients received 610 saphenous vein grafts. 83% of 
the IMA were anastomosed to the LAD and its branches, 12% to the circumflex and 
5% to the right coronary artery. 4 patients (0.98%) died postoperatively, 402 
survived and are free of angina. In our experience the IMA can be used routinely 
with low operative risk and good results.

Regardless the general acceptance of cardiac operations by physicians and 
patients as routine procedures since the early seventies conventional cardiac 
surgery is still associated with a significant surgical trauma and exceptional 
invasiveness in part effected by the extracorporeal circulation. In parallel to 
the common interest of nearly all surgical fields to minimize the invasiveness 
of surgery the intentions in cardiac surgery aim at minimizing surgical access 
on the one hand and avoidance of extracorporeal circulation on the other hand. 
Subsequently a broad variety in applying minimal surgical access including total 
endoscopic procedures as well as beating heart surgery without extracorporeal 
circulation with modified cannulation and clamping technology was investigated. 
Out of these three different concepts were essentially developed for coronary 
surgery. 1. The MIDCAB (minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass) 
procedure with revascularisation of the LAD through an anterior mini-thoracotomy 
using the left IMA on the beating heart. 2. The OPCAB (off-pump coronary artery 
bypass) procedure by use of a median complete or partial sternotomy with 
multi-vessel revascularisation on the beating heart. 3. The TECAB (totally 
endoscopic coronary artery bypass) procedure with total endoscopic access 
usually under conditions of extracorporeal circulation. Concluding from 
significant experience over several years MIDCAB and OPCAB procedures are 
adequately accepted and can be offered for suitable patients. Regarding the 
yearly case-load of around 70,000 procedures in coronary surgery in Germany 
minimally invasive techniques are applied in just up to 4-5%. The individual 
coronary anatomy and presence of co-morbidities represent essential selection 
factors deciding over the potential use of minimally invasive techniques.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the configuration of colic vessels in Chinese and its 
influence on the operation of esophageal replacement with colon (ERC).
METHODS: The origin, trend, branching, configuration, and distribution of the 
colic vessels, the intensity of the colic arterial impulse, the integrity of the 
marginal artery at the splenic flexure and hepatic flexure of colon were 
observed during the operation of ERC among 582 patients undergoing ERC, 402 
males mad 180 females, aged 2 approximately 74, from 22 provinces, municipality, 
and autonomous regions.
RESULTS: The left colic artery (LCA) stemmed from the inferior mesenteric artery 
(IMA) in 97.3% of the patients, with an absence rate of 0.7%. The middle colic 
artery (MCA) stemmed from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in 77.8% of the 
patients with an absence rate of 8.2%. Accessory middle colic artery (acMCA), 
originating from the right colic artery, could be seen in 6.2% of the patients 
39.7% of the right colic artery (RCA) stemmed from the SMA by itself, 23.0% of 
the RMA stemmed together with MCA, and 28.0% of the RCA stemmed together with 
the ileocolic artery. The absence rate of RCA was 9.8%. The intactness rate of 
marginal artery was 96.8% at the splenic flexure of colon, and was 88.7% at the 
hepatic flexure. The Rolan arch was seen in only 7.6% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: The configuration of colic vessels in Chinese was basically similar 
to those of the results of autopsies carried out abroad. The optimal supply 
artery of colic segment during ERC is LCA, followed by LCA. Attention should be 
paid to the integrity of marginal arteries and veins in the patients with 
history of epigastric operation.

IMPORTANCE: Worsening chronic heart failure (HF) is a major public health 
problem.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal dose and tolerability of vericiguat, a 
soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, in patients with worsening chronic HF and 
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Dose-finding phase 2 study that randomized 
456 patients across Europe, North America, and Asia between November 2013 and 
January 2015, with follow-up ending June 2015. Patients were clinically stable 
with LVEF less than 45% within 4 weeks of a worsening chronic HF event, defined 
as worsening signs and symptoms of congestion and elevated natriuretic peptide 
level requiring hospitalization or outpatient intravenous diuretic.
INTERVENTIONS: Placebo (n = 92) or 1 of 4 daily target doses of oral vericiguat 
(1.25 mg [n = 91], 2.5 mg [n = 91], 5 mg [n = 91], 10 mg [n = 91]) for 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was change from baseline to 
week 12 in log-transformed level of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP). The primary analysis specified pooled comparison of the 3 
highest-dose vericiguat groups with placebo, and secondary analysis evaluated a 
dose-response relationship with vericiguat and the primary end point.
RESULTS: Overall, 351 patients (77.0%) completed treatment with the study drug 
with valid 12-week NT-proBNP levels and no major protocol deviation and were 
eligible for primary end point evaluation. In primary analysis, change in 
log-transformed NT-proBNP levels from baseline to week 12 was not significantly 
different between the pooled vericiguat group (log-transformed: baseline, 7.969; 
12 weeks, 7.567; difference, -0.402; geometric means: baseline, 2890 pg/mL; 12 
weeks, 1932 pg/mL) and placebo (log-transformed: baseline, 8.283; 12 weeks, 
8.002; difference, -0.280; geometric means: baseline, 3955 pg/mL; 12 weeks, 2988 
pg/mL) (difference of means, -0.122; 90% CI, -0.32 to 0.07; ratio of geometric 
means, 0.885, 90% CI, 0.73-1.08; P = .15). The exploratory secondary analysis 
suggested a dose-response relationship whereby higher vericiguat doses were 
associated with greater reductions in NT-proBNP level (P < .02). Rates of any 
adverse event were 77.2% and 71.4% among the placebo and 10-mg vericiguat 
groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with worsening chronic HF and reduced 
LVEF, compared with placebo, vericiguat did not have a statistically significant 
effect on change in NT-proBNP level at 12 weeks but was well-tolerated. Further 
clinical trials of vericiguat based on the dose-response relationship in this 
study are needed to determine the potential role of this drug for patients with 
worsening chronic HF.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the potential roles of ischemia modified 
albumin(IMA) and D-dimer as reliable early diagnostic markers of ovarian 
torsion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 Wistar albino rats were included and randomized into 
three groups. Control (sham) rats underwent laparotomy then bilateral ovaries 
removed for histopathological examination and concomitant blood sampling for IMA 
and D-dimer assays after 4 h. In the remaining groups, ovarian ischemia was 
achieved by rotating bilateral ovaries 1080° clockwise then blood samples were 
obtained and ovaries were removed after 4 h and 24 h. IMA and D-dimer levels as 
well as the histopathological injury scores were assessed in all groups.
RESULTS: A statistically higher significant difference in D-dimer levels in the 
4-h torsion group (Group 2) than the other groups (P = 0.001, P < 0.01). Despite 
absence of statistical significance, the difference in IMA levels between the 
groups was close to statistical significance (P = 0.064; P > 0.05); accordingly 
IMA levels were higher in the 24-h torsion group (Group 3), than in 4-h torsion 
(Group 2) or sham (Group 1) group.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that D-dimer may represent a valuable acute 
marker of ovarian torsion. The cut-off value for D-dimer was 402 ng/ml. Although 
rats in Group3 had higher IMA than in other groups, the difference was only 
close to statistical significance. Also, increasing duration of torsion was 
associated with reduced D-dimer levels, while IMA levels exhibited an increase 
during the 24 h period. In contrast with previous studies, IMA appeared to be a 
potential marker in the long term rather than the short term.

This study aims to evaluate the association between target vessel size and graft 
patency in the right IMA-right coronary territory anastomosis.A total of 402 
patients who underwent CABG between 2005 and 2016 using the right IMA Y-graft to 
the posterolateral branch or posterior descending artery were enrolled. 
Preoperative coronary angiography was utilized to measure the size of the target 
coronary arteries in the right territory. Follow-up angiography and computed 
tomography at 6 to 12 months were used to determine graft patency.Thirty 
patients (7.5%) were found to have occluded graft. Larger target vessel size was 
associated with lower risk of graft occlusion (OR: 0.18, 95% CI:0.05-0.62, 
P = .007). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the 
cutoff-value of 1.93 mm was found to have the maximum sum of sensitivity and 
specificity for graft patency (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.65, P = .01). 
Excluding patients with right coronary artery total occlusion, the 
discriminative performance of target vessel size became more prominent (AUC: 
0.76, P < .01), with same cutoff value.In the setting of bilateral IMA composite 
grafting, the patency of right IMA to right coronary territory was influenced by 
the size of the target coronary artery. The influence of target coronary artery 
size was prominent in non-total occlusion patients. Careful selection of a 
target anastomosis site is recommended.

BACKGROUND: According to the latest the World Health Organization (WHO) 
classification in 2015, invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) is defined as a 
new pathological subtype of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, whether this 
rare subtype of lung pathology has any difference in prognosis than conventional 
LUAD is debatable. Our study attempted to compare clinical characteristics and 
prognosis of IMA vs. noninvasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (NMA).
METHODS: A total of 1,857 patients with LUAD who underwent radical resection 
were screened from 2010 to 2015 at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Patients with 
pulmonary IMA were matched 1:1 by using propensity scores with LUAD adjusted for 
clinicopathological characteristics. After follow-up, overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) were explored by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression 
analyses. Forest plots were used for subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Following screening, 499 patients with LUAD were enrolled, with 97 IMA 
and 402 NMA. Compared to NMA of the lung, IMA was proportionately lower in women 
(50.5% vs. 63.4%; P=0.026) and nonsmokers (P<0.001). IMA was also associated 
with earlier tumor stage I (68.0% vs. 55.5%; P=0.033) and lower frequency of 
upper lobe tumors compared to NMA (P=0.007). Following propensity score 
matching, 97 pairs were selected, among which we found that patients with 
pulmonary IMA had a longer OS than those with NMA (P=0.014). According to the 
subgroup analysis, improved OS in the IMA cohort versus the NMA cohort was 
observed across various factors, including the absence of lymphovascular 
invasion or perineural invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that resectable IMA patients had a better 
OS than NMA patients. This study contributes to the understanding of IMA in 
depth, but it needs to be validated through additional multicenter studies.

(1) Background: With the increasing life expectancy in the Western world, an 
increasing number of old patients presents with spinal meningioma. Considering 
the benign nature of these tumors, the functional outcome remains of great 
importance, since more people reach old age in general conditions of well-being 
and satisfactory autonomy. (2) Methods: We conducted an international 
multicenter retrospective study to investigate demographic, clinical and 
radiological data in a population of elderly patients (≥75 years of age) 
undergoing surgery for SM from January 2000 to December 2020 in four European 
referral centers. The aim was to identify prognostic and predictive factors for 
a good postoperative functional outcome. (3) Results: 72 patients were included 
in the study. Complete tumor resection (Simpson I or II) was achieved in 67 
(95.7%) cases. Intraoperative complications were reported in 7 (9.9%) patients 
while postoperative complications were found in 12 (16.7%). An excellent general 
postoperative status (McCormick I and II) was achieved in 65.3%. Overall, 
surgical resection had a good impact on patients’ functional outcome (86.1% 
either showing an improvement or maintaining a good preoperative status). Uni- 
and multivariate analyses found that both age and preoperative modified 
McCormick independently correlated with relative outcome (coeff = −0.058, p = 
0.0251; coeff = 0.597, p < 0.0001) and with postoperative status (coeff = 0.058, 
p = 0.02507; coeff = 0.402, p = 0.00027), respectively. (4) Conclusions: Age and 
preoperative modified McCormick were found to be independent prognostic factors. 
Nevertheless, advanced age (≥75), per se, did not seem to contraindicate 
surgery, even in those with severe preoperative neurological deficits. The 
functional results sustain the need for surgical resection of SM in the elderly.
